        strive to protect your personal information, you acknowledge that: (a)
        there are security and privacy limitations inherent to the Internet
        which are beyond our control; and (b) security, integrity, and privacy
        of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through
        this Site cannot be guaranteed.
